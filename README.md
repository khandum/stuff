Have questions?

Here's the probability that I'll answer you vs searching google:

Let...

A = answer to your question if you ...<br/>
G = search google<br/>
K = ask Khan when he's busy<br/>
K' = ask Khan when he's not busy<br/>

Then...

P(A|K) = 0<br/>
P(A|K') = 1/TREE(3)<br/>
P(A|G) = 1 - 1/TREE(3)<br/>
